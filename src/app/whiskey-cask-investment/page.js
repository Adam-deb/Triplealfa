                    <li><strong>Acquisition:</strong> You select a cask based on its potential value, age, and brand reputation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maturation:</strong> As the whisky matures, its flavor profile develops, and its value appreciates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exit Strategy:</strong> Once matured, the whisky can be bottled and sold, or the cask itself can be sold to collectors or investors at a premium price.</li>
